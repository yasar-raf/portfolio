    "content": "<p>You don't need deep algorithms or system internals — just the high-level tech basics, what they solve, key trade-offs, and when to pull in engineering.</p><h1><strong><em>What You DON'T Need to Know</em></strong></h1><p>PMs sometimes feel pressure to understand every technical detail. You don't.</p><p>You can safely <strong>NOT</strong> know:</p><ul><li>How to implement a binary search tree</li><li>The difference between <code>O(n)</code> and <code>O(log n)</code> complexity</li><li>How exactly a GPU processes tensor operations</li><li>The intricacies of memory management in C++</li><li>Exactly which AWS service to choose</li><li>How to write production code</li><li>Database indexing algorithms</li><li>Network protocol specifications</li></ul><h1><strong><em>What You DO Need to Know</em></strong></h1><p>You need to know enough to:</p><ul><li>Ask intelligent questions</li><li>Understand what problems different technologies solve</li><li>Evaluate trade-offs (speed vs cost vs complexity)</li><li>Recognize when something is complex</li><li>Translate technical constraints to stakeholders</li><li>Know when to defer to engineering expertise</li></ul><h1><strong><em>The Balance</em></strong></h1><h2><strong><em>Too Little Technical Knowledge</em></strong></h2><p><strong>PM:</strong> "Just make it work, I don't care how"</p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><ul><li>Engineers frustrated</li><li>Bad decisions made</li><li>No collaboration</li><li>Unrealistic expectations</li></ul><h2><strong><em>Too Much Technical Knowledge</em></strong></h2><p><strong>PM:</strong> "Actually, we should use Kafka instead of RabbitMQ because of partition rebalancing..."</p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><ul><li>You're doing engineer's job</li><li>Neglecting PM responsibilities</li><li>Team unclear on roles</li><li>Decision paralysis</li></ul><h2><strong><em>Just Right Technical Knowledge</em></strong></h2><p><strong>PM:</strong> "Help me understand the trade-offs so we can make the best decision for the product"</p><p><strong>Result:</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborative decision-making</li><li>Clear roles</li><li>Informed choices</li><li>Mutual respect</li></ul><h1><strong><em>Real Example</em></strong></h1><p><strong>Engineer:</strong> "We need to migrate to microservices"</p><p>❌ <strong>Too Little:</strong> "What are microservices?"</p><p>❌ <strong>Too Much:</strong> "Let's use event-driven architecture with CQRS and event sourcing..."</p><p>✅ <strong>Just Right:</strong> "What problems with our current setup does this solve? What's the migration cost and risk? How does this affect our ability to ship features?"</p><h2><strong><em>Another Example</em></strong></h2><p><strong>Engineer:</strong> "The API is slow because of N+1 queries"</p><p>❌ <strong>Too Little:</strong> "Just fix it" (dismissive)</p><p>❌ <strong>Too Much:</strong> "We should implement eager loading with joins and add database indexes on foreign keys..." (too technical)</p><p>✅ <strong>Just Right:</strong> "Help me understand: Is this a database issue or code issue? How many users are affected? Can we fix this incrementally or does it need a full rewrite?"</p><h1><strong><em>Your Role</em></strong></h1><p><strong>Trust engineers on:</strong> Implementation details, technology choices, architecture decisions</p><p><strong>Lead the team on:</strong> Strategic direction, product priorities, customer problems, business trade-offs</p><h1><strong><em>The Bottom Line</em></strong></h1><p>Your job is <strong>synthesis and decision-making</strong>, not technical implementation.</p><p>Know enough to be a <strong>good thought partner</strong>.
